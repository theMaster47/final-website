		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Spending time with family</strong></dt>
			<dd>Nothing is more important to me than family. I would do anything for them. I enjoy spending time with them, whether it be game night, movie night, or just a walk in the park.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Singing and dancing</strong></dt>
			<dd>I was born and raised in the midwest so show choir was a big part of my life. Both my older sisters were in it and I loved it with every fiber of my being. I did it for over five years and was a captain for close to three of those years. I still love singing with my family or on my own and enjoy going swing dancing.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Frisbee golf and ultimate frisbee</strong></dt>
			<dd>Ever since I was young, I loved frisbee, whether it be my dad and I trying to see if we can hit that tree, or playing it in gym. In high school, I excelled at it. And playing frisbee golf with my dad will always bring me great memories of my childhood.</dd>
